# ECOSCENE Development Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Focus:** UI Development with Dummy Data

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for building the ECOSCENE platform's user interface with dummy data. The initial focus is on creating a fully functional UI that demonstrates all platform features before implementing backend functionality.

## Development Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI) or Ant Design
